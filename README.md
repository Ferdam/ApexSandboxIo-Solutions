# ApexSandboxIo-Solutions
My collection of solutions for some of the problems found in https://www.apexsandbox.io/

## Some notes:
- I wrote these solutions, you may use them as you like, I don't care
- Optimization wasn't my focus, so feel free to improve it as you like
  - I was also exploring alternatives to complete the challenges, so take that into consideration
- If you want to do the same with your own solution, there are a few basic Chrome Console scripts to automate some of the boring process:
  - A script that outputs json formatted data with local code saved for the website, located in your browser's Local Storage
    - Place it in root folder as `SolutionMap.json`
  - A script that outputs apexsandbox.io folder structure and problem names as json formatted data
    - Place it in root folder as `ProblemFolderMapping.json`
  - Lastly, a NodeJs script that will automatically create all folders and files with existing code, based on json files you created from previous 2 scripts
    - Files will be created under `root\Solutions\`
        Example: `root\Solutions\<Problem Category Folder>\<Problem Name>.cls`
